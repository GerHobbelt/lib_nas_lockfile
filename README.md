# lib_nas_lockfile

API for using lockfiles on local and remote storage in a pluriform network environment. 

Includes staleness checks to recover after a lock-holding node/application crashed.


# API

- `create_lock()`: create the lockfile. Return failure when lockfile is already locked by others or otherwise cannot be created.
- `delete_lock()`: delete the lockfile we own.
- `refresh_lock()`: update the lockfile to signal *freshness* of the lock to everyone monitoring the lock, i.e. "kicking the watchdog" in embedded dev parlance.
- `monitor_for_lock_availability()`: periodically checks the lockfile to discover *staleness* (the **opposite of freshness**) or *absence* of the lockfile, i.e. *wait for opportunities to create the lockfile*. 
- `nuke_stale_lock()`: delete the lockfile when it has been found to be *stale* (by `monitor_for_lock_availability()`). Return failure when the lockfile could not *legally* be cleaned up. Return warning when the lockfile has already been cleaned (*refreshed* or *nuked*) by another application / network node.

## Requirements

- All nodes / applications sharing the same lockfile MUST use the same refresh interval Â± 25% \[*Tolerance includes round-trip network latency*]

- The refresh interval and **staleness factor** (used by `monitor_for_lock_availability()`) MUST be chosen so network latency cannot negatively impact lockfile monitoring, which would lead `monitor_for_lock_availability()` to **prematurely** conclude the lockfile *stale*.

  An example to clarify: say your network server (NAS or other) where the lockfile will be stored has an estimated worst-case round-trip response time of 200ms for filesystem I/O -- this includes multiple network messages and server disk I/O operations! this response time is the *total time* it takes to receive a result for a filesystem operation such as `mkdir` -- and your refresh interval is set to 300ms, then the *staleness factor* must be set to .................FORMULA............................

- Your application MUST have directory and file creation, edit and delete rights for the path specified where the 'lockfile' will be created.



## Notes

- The *lockfile* is constructed from a *lock directory* (created atomically by `mkdir()`, see section **Rationale** below for an elaboration) and a regular file created within that subdirectory for we can easily update the *mtime* of a file, but updating the *mtime* of a directory is a little haphazard across filesystems & operating systems.

- *staleness* is detected by monitoring the *mtime* of the lockfile. Because many filesystem network systems which are not professionally managed and monitored 24/7 can suffer from 'out of sync' clocks, we monitor for *mtime* **change** to observe *freshness* as we cannot rely on the absolute timestamp itself. 

  > Though this particular problem is gradually reduced over time as more systems implicitly use NTP to synchronize their local clock to a master beat without the need for administrative effort. Nevertheless, this issue has been observed on several household and semi-professional NAS installations and MUST NOT cause this locking system to fail with hard-to-diagnose failure modes such as incorrect staleness detection and consequent lock removal action.
  
- The *nuke* operation, which aims to remove a *stale* lock, has several potential race conditions, all of which are accounted for in the library code:   
  - two or more network nodes may detect *staleness* at the same time and take action simultaneously. Hence *nuking* can only be done *after* we have acquired another lock! (a.k.a. the *nuke lockfile*)
  - when the node which acquired the *nuke lock* crashes or otherwise fails to release *that* lockfile, we now have a recursive staleness detection problem!
  - [CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html): when you use the API to check for *staleness* (`monitor_for_lock_availability()`) and then call the `nuke_stale_lock()` action, someone else MAY have cleaned up already! *And* acquired a fresh lock already as well! Hence `nuke_stale_lock()` must acquire a *nuke lock* before re-checking the freshness of the filelock that was suspected to be *stale*, and only when it finds thelockfile is *still* stale, *nuke* it.

the lockfile mechanism uses `mkdir()` as an atomic operation (see section **Rationale** below for an elaboration). Hence y
